## Project 1: How to find π?

The following project utilizes a Monte Carlo simulation, using varying levels of precision and graphically depicting random points generated within a unit square and differentiating between points that are inside and outside of the unit circle

Using the Monte Carlo method, the project estimates π via random point generation within a square with side length 2. The points inside in the circle are tracked and the ratio of the inside points to the total number of points allows us to approximate π. These calculations continue until the difference between the consecutive estimates of π fall below the precision level threshold. 

# Features:
